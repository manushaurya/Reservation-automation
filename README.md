# Python-script to Automate the reservation process from IRCTC

Disclaimer : Since IRCTC might have changed the user interface since we developed this script, this might not work now and might need modifications.

This script was purely developed as a demonstration of website automation from login to the passenger information fill up into the reservation page which significantly optimized the client side interaction. We only used it for educational purposes and not for ticket reservation end to end.
